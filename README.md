# Micro MVC(ish) Web Framework

Micro JS Web Framework built for fun. Used by [https://github.com/bbraithwaite/sf-movies-web/tree/noframeworks](https://github.com/bbraithwaite/sf-movies-web/tree/noframeworks).

Basic Features:

* Loosely based on MVC
* Querystring Parsing
* Dependency Injection
* Routing
* Template Rendering with model binding (one-way)
* Doesn't do much!

For fun, not production!
